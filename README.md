# ContourPlatform
Contour blockchain letter of credit is a wonderful platform for the trade finance sector. Even though many companies were skeptical about using distributed ledger technology for the trade finance sector, but it indeed provides a better solution to all of the issues this industry deals with.

After the live project in 14 different countries, which included more than 50 corporates and banks, it’s moving into commercial launch. According to results, it can execute the whole process of Letter of Credit within 24 hours rather than 10 days!

That’s a milestone for the blockchain technology as well. At present, the venture is setting up in Singapore for the launch, and after that, we’ll get more insight into what the system is capable of.

## History of The Contour Blockchain Consortium
In 2016, the Contour blockchain consortium formed with twelve banks backing them up. Initially, their target clients were large importers and exporters, along with banks that deal with a rising number of trade volumes.

Later on, 2017, they completed their second Voltron blockchain A.K.A. Contour blockchain prototype. Practically, in 2018, they completed their first live project.

Anyhow, they previously planned to set up management for the Contour blockchain consortium in October 2019 and plans to make the platform production-worthy in 2020.

In reality, the delivery partners, member banks, and external investors have the ownership of the platform.

## Examples of Transactions Completed
### Issuing Bank
HSBC, Bangkok Bank, ING, BNP Paribas, and Standard Chartered.

### Advising Bank
ING, HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Bangkok Bank.

### Importer
Bukitmega Masabadi, Tricon, Cargill, Babyshop, Landmark Group, PTT Group, and China SDIC Int’l Trade Nanjing.

### Exporter
GC Marketing Solutions, Bee Dee Industries, Cargill, RioTinto, Reliance, Fox and Lille, and IRPC.

Their very first live data tradition on the platform included Cargill, ING, and HSBC. Additionally, here they issued a digital letter of credit for exported soybeans from Argentina to Malaysia. The best part is that in that live transaction, they managed to reduce the time from 10 days to 24 hours!

## Why Is Contour Using Corda?
Contour blockchain is powered by R3‘s enterprise blockchain Corda platform. But why are they using Corda for trade finance? Can it really pull it off? Let’s see some of the benefits of using Corda as the underlying technology.

### Immutability
In the Corda platform, no one can tamper with the ledger. Once data gets an entry into the system, no one can modify it or alter it in any way. So, it’s fully tamper-proof.

### Full-proof Verification
All of the information on the ledger goes through the verification process to check whether it’s authentic or not.

### Interoperability
Corda does maintain privacy, but it also helps nodes to transact without liquidity issues or creating islands of assets.

### Privacy and Security
In the platform, only the nodes allowed to see certain information can see them. Other nodes that don’t have access to it can’t see the information, thus preserving privacy.

### Easy Integration
Inte### grating into the existing banking system is super easy with Corda. More so, you can even use standard language such as Java for coding the contracts.

### Transparency
It c### omes with a wide range of consensus algorithm. So, you can achieve consensus on every single deal rather than at the system level.

### Consistent Data
All ### of the data across multiple ledgers in the system are consistent. So, there would be no issues of mismatching information.

### Smart Contracts
You can## so use smart contract features in the system, which will save your time and resources.
